Unfortunately Translation is treated differently (addition) from scaling & rotation (multiplication) we would like to be able to treat all three transformations in a consistent way, So that they can be combined easily. So, that the final coordinate position are obtained directly from initial coordinates without calculating intermediate coordinate value.
We can do this by Reformulating P' = M1* P + M2  to eliminate the matrix addition operation.
If we expand the representation from 2*2 into 3*3 matrix , so all Transformation Eq. can be expressed as matrix multiplication. 
To express any two-dimensional transformation as a matrix multiplication, we represent each Cartesian coordinate position (x,y) with the Homogeneous coordinate triple (xh,yh, h)
If these points are expressed in Homogeneous Coordinates, all three transformations can be treated as multiplication.
In Homogeneous Coordinate we add a third coordinate to a point instead of being represented by a pair of number (x,y) each point is represented by a triple (xh,yh,h).
At the same time we say that two sets of Homogeneous coordinates (xh,yh,h) & (x’h,y’h,h’) represent the same point if and only if one is a multiple of other thus (2,3,6) & (4,6,12) are the same points represented by different coordinate triples
That is each point has many different homogeneous coordinates represents also, at least one of the Homogeneous coordinates must be non zero: (0,0,0) is not allowed.
If the h coordinate is nonzero, we can divide through by it (x,y,h) represent the same point as (x⁄h, y⁄h,1) where h≠0
